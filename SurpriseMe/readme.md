- `content.js`

- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

#### 3. Install the Extension
1. Open Chrome browser
2. Enter `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the folder containing all files
6. Extension installed!

### How to Use

#### Basic Usage
1. Click the extension icon in the browser toolbar
2. Click "Random Border Color" in the popup
3. The browser border will immediately change to a random color
4. Click "Remove Border Color" to remove the border

### Technical Implementation

#### Core Technologies
- **Manifest V3**: Uses the latest Chrome extension API
- **Content Scripts**: Injects border elements into pages
- **Storage API**: Saves color settings for each tab
- **Message Passing**: Communication between popup and content script

#### Border Implementation
- Uses `position: fixed` to create a border element covering the entire viewport
- Sets `pointer-events: none` to ensure it doesn't interfere with page interactions
- Uses the highest `z-index` to ensure the border is always visible
- Implements `mix-blend-mode` for color blending effects

### File Structure

```
surprise-me/
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json          # Extension configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ popup.html            # Popup interface
â”œâ”€â”€ popup.js              # Popup logic
â”œâ”€â”€ content.js            # Content script
â”œâ”€â”€ background.js         # Background script
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css            # Styles
â”œâ”€â”€ icon16.png            # 16x16 icon
â”œâ”€â”€ icon48.png            # 48x48 icon
â””â”€â”€ icon128.png           # 128x128 icon
```

### Color Scheme

The extension includes 35 carefully selected colors:
- Includes warm, cool, and neutral tones
- Ensures good visibility on various backgrounds
- Moderate saturation to avoid being too harsh on the eyes

### Notes

1. **Compatibility**: Only supports Chrome browser (and other Chromium-based browsers)
2. **Permissions**: The extension needs access to all websites to add border effects
3. **Performance**: Border elements use CSS hardware acceleration for minimal performance impact
4. **Privacy**: All data is stored locally and not uploaded to any server

### Troubleshooting

#### Border Not Showing
- Check if the extension is properly installed and enabled
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if the browser is blocking content scripts

#### Color Not Saving
- Make sure the browser allows the extension to access storage permissions
- Check if you're using incognito mode

#### Extension Not Loading
